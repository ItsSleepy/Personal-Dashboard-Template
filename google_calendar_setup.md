## Dashboard Configuration

### Step 6: Configure Your Dashboard

2. Click the **Settings** button (‚öôÔ∏è) in the footer

   - Your Google Calendar events in the upcoming events list
   - Days with events marked on the monthly calendar
   - Real-time sync when you click the sync button

## Features

### What You Can Do

- **View Events**: See upcoming events from your Google Calendar
- **Add Local Events**: Create events directly in the dashboard
- **Monthly Calendar**: Visual calendar with event indicators
- **Automatic Sync**: Manual sync with Google Calendar
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different event types
- **Event Details**: View event descriptions and times

### Limitations

- **Read-Only Google Events**: You can view Google Calendar events but not edit them from the dashboard
- **Manual Sync**: Events don't auto-sync; you need to click the sync button
- **Public Calendar Required**: Google Calendar must be public for API access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to sync Google Calendar"**
- Check your API key is correct and properly restricted
- Ensure your calendar is public
- Verify the Calendar ID matches your actual calendar
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**"No events showing"**
- Make sure your calendar has events in the next 30 days
- Verify Samsung Calendar is syncing with Google Calendar
- Check that the correct calendar ID is being used

**"API quota exceeded"**
- Google Calendar API has daily limits (usually sufficient for personal use)
- If exceeded, wait 24 hours or create a new project

### Security Notes

- **API Key Security**: Never share your API key publicly
- **Calendar Privacy**: Remember that making a calendar public means anyone with the link can view it
- **Consider**: Use a separate calendar for dashboard sync to maintain privacy

## Alternative: Manual Event Management

If you prefer not to use Google Calendar API, you can:
1. Use the **"Add Event"** button to manually create events
2. These will be stored locally in your browser
3. You'll have full control over event management
4. Events will sync across browser sessions on the same device
